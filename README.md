# ANN Learning Projects

Personal project to learn what is ANN by working through the [Neural Networks and Deep Learning textbook](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen. Also most models are not built from scratch by programming a node and choosing it's activation function, I want to learn/apply PyTorch and TensorFlow to build a few models for some mini projects. Current projects in mind: 
1. Pokemon Classification - Identifying all pokemons in an image and labeling them with their names. 

2. AI Painter - Using a GNN model to learn how to paint landscape/backgrounds in a digital art style. Maybe branch out to other art styles too?
